## Rankability Problem Library (RPLib)

The Rankability Problem Library (RPLib) contains data, solutions, and analysis for a wide range of ranking problems. Example data includes ranking problems for sports (e.g., NCAA, NFL), economics, and fairness (e.g., US News and World Report, AirBnB). The library provides raw and derived datasets for researchers as well as known solutions and analysis. This is an open repository and contributions from the community are welcome.

### Data, Analysis, and Solution Browser
The main interface for RPLib is the dataset browser. This easy to navigate interface allows users to search and filter datasets. Once a subset of interest is returned, users may view analysis results or choose to download data and solutions.
