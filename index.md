## Rankability Problem Library (RPLib)

The Rankability Problem Library (RPLib) contains data, solutions, and analysis for a wide range of ranking problems. Example data includes ranking problems for sports (e.g., NCAA, NFL), economics, and fairness (e.g., US News and World Report, AirBnB). The library provides raw and derived datasets for researchers as well as known solutions and analysis. This is an open repository and contributions from the community are welcome.
