## Rankability Problem Library (RPLib)

The Rankability Problem Library (RPLib) contains problem instances structured to study a datasets ability to support a ranking independent of or associated with particular ranking pipelines. A ranking pipeline is a series of preprocessing and transformation steps that build the input for a ranking algorithm. In order to solve ranking problems, practitioners must not only choose the final ranking algorithm (e.g., Massey, Colley, PageRank) they must also choose from a set of potential pipelines that transform the original dataset into the input of the ranking algorithm. This open and public repository with problems available for the research community. 

### Problem Definitions
Problem definitions may be found in [RPLib/problems/](http://https://github.com/IGARDS/RPLib/problems/). The documentation and preparation of each problem instance is located in notebooks called generate.ipynb (e.g., [RPLLib/problems/problem_0001/generate.ipynb](http://https://github.com/IGARDS/RPLib/problems/problem_0001/generate.ipynb). Many rankability problems may branch off from a single generate.ipynb. These should be called problem_0001a, problem_0001b, etc.

### Problem Submissions
Submissions to rankability problems are cataloged alongside generate.ipynb and should be named such as submission_0001_problem_0001a.ipynb.

### Problem Submission Synthesis
Different rankability problems have different objectives and as such a manual submission synthesis is performed to update overall progress on a problem instance.
