Some further benchmark instances have been created and used by Schiavinotto and St√ºtzle (2004). These instances were generated from the real-world input-output tables by replicating them to obtain larger problems. Thus, the distribution of numbers in these instances somehow reflects real input-output tables, but otherwise they behave more like random problems. Tha data set has been called XLOLIB, instances with n = 150 and n = 250 are available. For each original input-output instance, two instances, one of size n =150 and another one of size n = 250 were generated. Therefore this set contains 98 instances (49 with size 150 and 49 with size 250). We have removed 20 of these instances because there entries were so large that the sum of entries was not representable as 4-byte integer. Therefore, this set finally has 78 instances.
