We added some further problem instances that were used for experiments in some publications. EX instances were used in particular in Christof (1997) and in Christof and Reinelt (1996).econ instances were generated from the matrix usa79. They turned out not to be solvable as linear program using only 3-dicycle inequalities. atp instances were created from the results of ATP tennis tournaments in 1993/1994. Nodes correspond to a selection of players and the weight of an arc (i, j) is the number of victories of player i against player j. Paley graphs have been used in Goemans and Hall (1996) to prove results about the acyclic subdigraph polytope. They are a special class of tournaments where adjacency comes from an algebraic definition. They are constructed from the members of a suitable finite field by connecting pairs of elements that differ in a quadratic residue.
