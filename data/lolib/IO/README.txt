Input/Output matrices: This is a well-known set of instances that contains 50 real-world linear ordering problems generated from input-output tables from various sources (Gr√∂tschel et al 1984). They are comparatively easy for nowadays metaheuristics and are thus more of interest for economists than for the assessment of approximate methods for hard problems. The original entries in these tables were not necessarily integral, but for \LOLIB\ they were scaled to integral values.
