This is a set with 175 random problems that has been widely used for experiments. Problems of type I (called RandomAI), are generated from a [0,100] uniform distribution. This type of problems was proposed in Reinetl (1985) and generated in Campos et al (2001). Problems were originally generated from a [0, 25000] uniform distribution in Laguna et al (1999) and modified afterwards, sampling from a significatively narrow range ([0,100]) to make them harder to solve. Sizes are n = 100, 150 and 200 and there are 25 instances in each set giving a total of 75. We have extended this set including 25 additional instances with sizen = 500. Download. Problems of type II, which we call RandomAII, are generated by counting the number of times a sector appears in a higher position than another in a set of randomly generated permutations. This type of problems was proposed in Chanas and Kobylanski (1996) and generated in Campos el al (2001). For a problem of size n, n/2 permutations are generated. There are 25 instances with sizes 100, 150 and 200, respectively.
